# testis_brain
This repository contains the scripts used for the analyses described in Bush and Goriely (2025) A role for the male germline in the expansion of the mammalian brain.

These analyses draw on a number of previously published datasets, including both transcriptomic and proteomic data from the [Human Protein Atlas (v23)](https://www.proteinatlas.org/), annotation information from Ensembl BioMart, and our previous work: an [integrated single-cell atlas of the adult human testis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38727278/). The scripts for that project are available [here](https://github.com/sjbush/spg_atlas) and, collectively, integrate 34 publicly-available testicular scRNA-seq datasets (from [Guo 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30315278/), [Hermann 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30404016/), [Sohni 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726734/), [Chen 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gendis.2020.09.004), [Guo 2020](http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31928944/), [Shami 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32504559/), [Zhao 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33173058/), [Di Persio 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34622232/), and [Nie 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35504286)). For the present work, the atlas in question is that produced by script 6 of [that repo](https://github.com/sjbush/spg_atlas/6.refine_clustering_of_whole_testes_atlas.R); specifically, the Seurat object in the file ‘human_adult.rds’.

Scripts should be run in numbered order, with more specific detail on usage and prerequisites (and commands for creating figures from their output, where appropriate) available as comments within the scripts themselves. The file ‘commands_for_creating_figures.txt’ details specific sources.
